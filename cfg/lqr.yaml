# LQR Config: 
# Tuning values for Q and R matrices
# Since the guidance controller provides feed-forward inputs, these values should roughly correspond to the maximum
# deviations allowed from the REFERENCE trajectory.
# Initial first guess: Qi = 1 / (max_state_deviation_i)^2
# Initial first guess: Ri = 1 / (max_input_deviation_i)^2

# NOTES: 
# 1. Xstate is the original 12-state vector
#    Xstate = [xI, yI, zI, U, V, W, q1, q2, q3, wx, wy, wz]^T
# 2. Xintegral is the integral state vector, appended to Xstate forming an augmented state vector Xaug = [Xstate, Xintegral]^T
#    Xintegral = [int(x_error) , int(y_error), int(z_error), int(q1_error), int(q2_error), int(q3_error)]^T
# 3. Q_diag is for the un-augmented system (Xstate only) and must have 12 elements, since Q is a 12x12 matrix
# 4. Q_int_diag is for the error states (Xintegral)
# 3. R_diag must have 8 elements
